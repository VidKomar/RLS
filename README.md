# RLS Task

The broad task requires the building of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that will be able to recover weather data for the past two days and display it visually. Emphasis was put on the GUI itself, but more importantly on the supporting work regarding good programming pracitices.

Repository which I have used to remember the art of python programming. My career took me into different waters, but now I am working hard on my return.

Besides a quick refresher course on the basics of programming, a lot of work was put into learning good programming pracitices. From unit testing, logging, pre-commiting to establishing a Continious Intigration (CI) pipeline. And that is only scraping the surface!

None of this is learned during formal education, so learning it on the job is a must.

There are a lot of things I could have done better, loops that could work faster, GUI that could look better, testing that could be more thorough. But juggling work, after work activities and solo learning of the described requirements is incredibly difficult.

## FAQ

#### Why did you set to create this app?

It was a programming task, related to a job application in the company RLS.
RLS design and manufacture angular magnetic encoder ICs, rotary and linear encoders, interpolator ICs and photodiode arrays for customers worldwide.

#### Would you say the task was difficult?

The task itself was not difficult. What was difficult was relearning coding, but even more so was learning all of the different principles of Continious Integration and things a good programmer must do, besides just write good code, under the pressure of time.

#### Are you happy with the results?

Yes. Even though the app could have been done better, I have learned plethora of new information, which was engaging and interesting.

Everything learned will help me on my career path, wherever it will take me.
