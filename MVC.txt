Model - manages the data and defines rules and behaviors.
    It represents the business logic of the application. The data can be
    stored in the Model itself or in a database
    (only the Model has access to the database).

View - presents the data to the user.
    A View can be any kind of output representation:
    a HTML page, a chart, a table, or even a simple text output.
    A View should never call its own methods; only a Controller should do it.

Controller - Accepts user's inputs and delegates
    data representation to a View
    data handling to a Model
